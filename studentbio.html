		<p>My name is Francis Ian. My education includes a B.S in Computer Engineering from UC Irvine and a M.S. in Engineering (Systems) from UCLA. Currently I am trying to transition my career from software quality assurance to web development. My favorite hobby is practicing martial arts. For music, I like listening to trance and attending raves. As far as books and movies, I enjoy The Hunger Games series because I relate a lot to the main character, Katniss Everdeen. With that connection in mind, you can always see my mockingjay pin worn on me.</p>
